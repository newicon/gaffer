# gaffer
minimal/experimental [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)/[composer](https://getcomposer.org/) based framework demo

__IMPORTANT NOTE :__    
__batteries not included ... this is very much a work in progress ... don't say you weren't warned!__

## requirements
- local webserver : apache2 (due to the current .htaccess requirement)
- PHP 8.1 +
- MySQL/Maria 15.1+
- interwebs! uses various CDN libraries
- SCSS if you wish to compile the css from sources

## structure
```/app``` - the demo app   
```/lib``` - any non-composer based libraries/dependencies (currently just a form handling library called Deform)   
```/public``` - the public html directory   
```/public/assets``` - fixed assets css/js/images/etc (in the repo)   
```/image``` - uploadable and/or resized images (not in the repo)   
```/media``` - media (not in the repo)   
```/vendor``` - composer deps + the project autoloader   

## installation
- clone this repo (duh!)
- setup hosts/vhosts (as required) pointing to /public
- create a /config.ini file like this, something like this
```
ENV = 'development'
DEBUG = 'true'
TIMEZONE = 'Europe/London'
EMAIL = 'gaffer@newicon.net'

DB_HOST = 'localhost'
DB_NAME = 'gaffer_dev'
DB_USER = 'root'
DB_PASS = 'root'
DB_CHAR = 'utf8'
```
- create a local database using the scripts in /sql
- run ```composer install```
- browse away!
- to view the admin area you will need to create an admin user via cli.php
```php cli.php add-user {email} {password}```
  
## notes
- highly [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) compliant
- highly [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) based ... uses the composer autoloader with additional PSR4 support
- auto-magic image resizing ... place an image in /image then use {image_name}\_{width}\_{height}.{extension} for intervention to resize it!
- as mentioned uses various CDN distributed libraries
- current composer dependencies are as follows:
  - [composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) : itself!

## todo
- security security security!
- separate the demo from the core & put it into its own repo
- where possible find existing open-source composer based libraries to replace functionality in /system and /lib:
    - favour light-weight libraries
    - favour mature/proven libraries
    - favour libraries with minimal dependencies of their own
- change the System namespace to Gaffer
- dedicated CLI bootstrap
- add a [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) based middleware support with a couple of example implementations 
- move the Deform library to its own repo
- unit/acceptance tests
- rename /image to /images!!
